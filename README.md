# localNotification-with-Text


This is an example of how to make notifications which take text as input. By using UserNotifications framework. 
I used UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger, UNMutableNotificationContent, UNNotificationAction, UNNotificationRequest classes provided in SDK.

According to apple doc we can use UNTextInputNotificationAction objects
to define an action that allows the user to provide a custom text-based response. the system displays controls for the user to enter text content.
